IMPORTANT: With the release of 1.2.0, **`FruityMesh`** has been renamed to **`BlueRange Mesh Community Edition`** to better reflect the fact that our commercial offering is just adding features on top of the open source variant but is built on the very same core architecture. So far, only the documentation has been updated, source code will follow later. Most importantly, the license stays the same.

BlueRange Mesh Community Edition is the reference implementation of the **BlueRange** initiative. It was the first open source implementation - known as FruityMesh - of a mesh network that is based on standard *Bluetooth Low Energy 4.1/5.x connections*. In contrast to mesh networks that use advertising and scanning, this allows for a network run with *battery powered* devices. BlueRange Mesh works with the Nordic nRF52 chipset in combination with the *S132/S140 SoftDevices* and enables tons of devices to connect to each other with its auto-meshing capabilities. It is *always connected* with configurable connection intervals of *7.5 ms to 4 seconds* while still being able to run on batteries. Connections also have the advantage of a much higher throughput than using a flooding mesh.
