= The Timeslot API

The nRF52 SDK and SoftDevice allows an application to have full control over the `RADIO` peripheral using the _Timeslot API_.
Usage of this API in BlueRange Mesh is handled via the `Timeslot` class, declared in `Timeslot.hpp` and the HAL.

In order to be used, the featureset must define `#define ACTIVATE_TIMESLOT 1` which makes the API available.

*Important:* Any code which has direct `RADIO` access will run with the highest interrupt priority (0) and can therefore *not* call _any_ SoftDevice functions, as these are implemented using software interrupts.
Additionally, the code running in this context must not run for longer than scheduled with the SoftDevice.
If it does, the device *will* Hardfault.
This in particular makes it hard to work with the Timeslot API, as it severely limits the programmers ability to debug.

During the `RADIO` callback, the application has also full control over the high-resolution timer, which should be used to get a notification right before the end of the scheduled timeslot in order to request an extension (if necessary).

If the Timeslot API is activated, the `NrfHalMemory` stores two additional values, the callback return parameter and the radio request.

Opening and closing a timeslot session, as well as registering callbacks are implemented in the `Timeslot` class (singleton) and the configuration of the `RADIO` peripheral and configuration of the request data structure are available in the `FruityHal::Radio...(...)` functions.
An example implementation which utilizes this API is available in the `RuuviWeatherModule`.

== Nordic Documentation

For more information on the usage of the Timeslot API, have a look at the following documents:

* The SoftDevice documentation for the S132 and S140 SoftDevice document the `sd_radio_...` functions in the _SoC Library API_ section.
  These functions control the Timeslot API and register the handlers for the `RADIO` events.
** `sd_radio_notification_cfg_set`
** `sd_radio_request`
** `sd_radio_session_close`
** `sd_radio_session_open`

* A fully fledged example for the nRF51 chips, for which the Timeslot API is also available can be found under

== Debugging Code in the Radio Signal Handler

The time allocated for execution of the code in the `RADIO` signal handler (i.e. running with the highest interrupt level) is limited by whatever was requested and subsequently granted by the SoftDevice.

It is *not* possible to print debugging output except by directly using the `SEGGER` API, as it only copies data to a memory buffer.
Keep in mind that this is also not necessarily safe, as the `RADIO` signal handler can interrupt almost any other code, including other code currently printing using the `SEGGER` API.
This is also hampered by the time-constraints, as string formatting is generally not particularly fast and one can easily trigger hardfaults.

One way to achieve this anyhow, is to copy values to some memory buffer and format and print them in a `TimerEventHandler`.
It is the programmers responsibility to make sure that the `RADIO` signal handler - which may interrupt the `TimerEventHandler` - does not write to the buffer while it is read.
Use atomic variables to guard against this - e.g. by setting a flag in the `TimerEventHandler` which signals that the buffer is currently being read and the `RADIO` signal handler should not write to it.

Another way to debug is to set or unset or toggle a GPIO pin, which might drive a LED or can be visualized with a Logic Analyzer.
This is usually pretty fast and will generally not significantly increase the wasted time in the `RADIO` signal handler, but only very limited information can be transmitted.
