= Basic Usage

== LED Codes
Nodes indicate some of their states by flashing LEDs, if available and enabled.
The LEDs are named after the colors red, green and blue.
If the hardware doesn't include colored LEDs (e.g. the nRF52840-DK), the LEDs are configured as LED1 for red, LED2 for green and LED3 for blue.
Below are some of the node states and the respective LED code.
Keep in mind that image:led_long_red.png[role=led-symbol] is used to indicate long LED flash (>1 sec) and image:led_short_red.png[role=led-symbol] is used to indicate short LED flash ( <1 sec).

|State |Sequence

| `powered_up_but_not_connected`: When a node is powered up but is not connected to any other node
| image:led_long_red.png[role=led-symbol]
| `while_performing_handshake`: When two nodes are connected to each other and performing handshake
| image:led_long_blue.png[role=led-symbol]
| `handshake_is_complete`: When handshake is complete. The number of LED blinks corresponds to number of active connections to other nodes
| image:led_short_green.png[role=led-symbol]image:led_short_green.png[role=led-symbol]
| `deviceoff_mode`:  When device is switched to DeviceOff mode

[#TerminalCommands]
== Terminal Commands
All classes can implement An interface called
`TerminalCommandListener` can be implemented for all classes. It allows each class to listen for commands entered via either the UART or Segger RTT terminal. These commands can be entered by the user or by a program such as a MeshGateway that connects a mesh to the internet.

Use a terminal or similar application to use one of the following commands as
detailed in xref:Quick-Start.adoc[Quick Start].

Some basic commands for testing the mesh are listed below. Content in
[brackets] has to be replaced by the user.

* *reset*: Reboots the system.
* *status*: Displays the node status, including its connections.
* *data*: Sends a test packet to all connected nodes and prints a response
once the output was received.
* *datal*: Sends a big test packet that is automatically split into
multiple writes over the mesh and prints a response when it was received.
* *action 0 io led [on/off]*: Broadcasts a packet to all nodes to switch
on/off their leds permanently.
* *action 0 status get_device_info*: Asks all nodes for their device
information.
* *debugtags*: Displays all log tags that are currently enabled.
* *debug [tagname]*: Toggle log output of the given tag. (ERROR and
WARNING are always printed.)
* *debug all* : Toggles logging of all messages, no matter what their
tag is (these are a lot of messages).
* *settime [unix timestamp] [offset minutes]*: Sets the time for the current node.
* *sendtime*: Broadcasts the current time over the mesh.
* *gettime*: Displays the current time.
* *startterm*: Displays a prompt and echos back the user's input
(default). Backspace is supported.
* *stopterm*: Uses an interrupt based input mode. Used for
communication with a control application. There is no echo of the
user input.
* *bufferstat*: Displays the contents of the JOIN_ME buffer, filled with discovery packets from surrounding nodes.
* *get_modules [nodeId]*: Displays a list of modules from the node and
whether they are active or not.

== More Commands

BlueRange Mesh is structured in Modules. Each module provides its own set of commands. A detailed listing of all available modules and their commands can be found on the xref:Modules.adoc[Modules] page.
